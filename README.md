## Development

Make sure you have Java and the Clojure CLI [installed](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started). There are ways to get by without these given this project mostly relies on Javascript, but using the Clojure JVM CLI allows us to resolve dependencies in a more flexible way, which comes in really handy when developing across dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
